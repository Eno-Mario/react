# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 1

Create a new React application with vite and remove all the files within the src folder. Inside src folder create a Hello function component that renders the "Hello, World!" message within an h2 tag. Write a function component called App that renders the Hello component within a div tag. Create a new index.jsx file within the src folder and render the App component using the createRoot function and the render method on the created root's object. Start the application with the npm run dev command and open the application in your browser (the default location is http://localhost:5173).
