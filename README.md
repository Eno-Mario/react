# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 11

Extract the h2 tag showing the counter state variable into a new component called CounterDisplay and render it within the Counter component, passing it the count state variable as a prop.

Add a decrement button and a reset button to the Counter component. The decrement button should decrement the counter by the amount passed as a prop, and the reset button should reset the counter to the initial value passed as a prop.
