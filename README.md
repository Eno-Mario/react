# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 28

Create a TodoList component that renders a ul tag with a li tag for each item contained in the todos state variable.
The todos state variable should be an array of strings.
The TodoList component should also contain an input tag and a button.
When the button is clicked, the event handler should add the value of the input tag to the todos array.
