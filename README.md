# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 10

Create an AlertClock function component that renders a button. When the button is clicked, an alert should be shown with the current time. Render the AlertClock component within the App component. Make it so that the event handler is received as a prop by the AlertClock component, instead of being implemented within the component itself. Tip: use the Date object to get the current time.
