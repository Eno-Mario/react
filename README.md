# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 27

Create a component called Color that receives an object called 'color' as a prop, which will have 2 properties, 'id' and 'name,' and returns an 'li' tag that displays the 'name' property. Create a second component called Colors, which takes an array of objects as a prop, where the properties are always 'name' and 'id,' and displays an unordered list of Color components.
