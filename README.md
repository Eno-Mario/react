# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 5

Create a Welcome function component that receives a name prop and renders the Welcome, {name}! message within a p tag.

Render this component to you App component, passing it a name prop of your choosing. What happens if no name prop is passed to the Welcome component? Can you set a default value for the name prop?
