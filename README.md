# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise 19

Add a "login" button to the Login component. This button should be disabled as long as the username and password inputs are empty. When clicked, the event handler attached to the button should call an onLogin function passed as a prop to the Login component, passing it the state, that will print the state value.
